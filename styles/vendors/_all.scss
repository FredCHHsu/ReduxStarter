// Vendors
// =======
//
// And last but not least, most projects will have a vendors/ folder
// containing all the CSS files from external libraries and frameworks
//  – Normalize, Bootstrap, jQueryUI, FancyCarouselSliderjQueryPowered,
// and so on. Putting those aside in the same folder is a good way to
// say “Hey, this is not from me, not my code, not my responsibility”.
//
// If you have to override a section of any vendor, I recommend you
// have athoer folder called vendors-extensions/ in which you may have
// files named exactly after the vendors they overwrite.
